# Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought Programming Prompt

When solving programming tasks or problems, please use a Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought approach. This methodology asks you to explore multiple reasoning paths and reconcile any conflicts to reach the optimal solution:

## 1. Problem Interpretation
- Restate the programming task in your own words
- Identify core requirements, inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities by stating reasonable assumptions

## 2. Multi-Path Reasoning
Generate at least two different reasoning paths to approach the problem:

### Path A:
- Outline initial thoughts and approach to solving the problem
- Identify key algorithms, data structures, or patterns relevant to this path
- Consider advantages and potential limitations of this approach

### Path B:
- Develop an alternative perspective or approach
- Consider different algorithms, architectures, or implementation strategies
- Evaluate strengths and potential drawbacks of this alternative

## 3. Critical Comparison
- Compare the reasoning paths, identifying trade-offs between:
  - Time complexity vs. space complexity
  - Simplicity vs. flexibility
  - Performance vs. maintainability
  - Short-term implementation speed vs. long-term scalability
- Identify any conflicts or contradictions between the paths
- Reconcile differences by explaining which aspects of each path are most valid

## 4. Harmonized Solution
- Synthesize insights from different reasoning paths into a coherent solution
- Develop a balanced approach that addresses the identified trade-offs
- Justify key design decisions with clear reasoning

## 5. Implementation
- Provide clean, well-structured, and properly formatted code
- Include appropriate error handling and edge case management
- Ensure the code follows best practices for the relevant language/framework

## 6. Verification & Reflection
- Analyze how your solution addresses all requirements
- Identify any remaining limitations or considerations
- Suggest potential improvements or alternatives if time and resources allowed

Throughout your response, explicitly show your reasoning process and explain how you're reconciling different perspectives to arrive at an optimal solution. Your final code should be directly implementable while incorporating the best insights from your multi-path reasoning process.
