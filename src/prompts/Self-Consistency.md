# Enhanced Self-Consistency Reasoning Framework

## Core Concept
This framework leverages multiple independent solution paths to increase problem-solving accuracy through consensus-based validation. By generating diverse high-quality solutions to the same problem and synthesizing their insights, you can identify robust approaches and mitigate individual reasoning failures.

## Framework Implementation

### Phase 1: Problem Decomposition and Strategy
- Analyze the problem thoroughly, identifying core components and requirements
- Recognize the technical domain and applicable methodologies
- Establish evaluation criteria for solution quality
- Define solution space parameters and constraints
- Determine appropriate diversity factors for solution generation
- Plan for consensus aggregation methodology

### Phase 2: Multiple Solution Path Generation
Generate 3-5 distinct, high-quality solution approaches with these characteristics:

#### Solution Diversity Requirements
- **Algorithmic Diversity**: Different fundamental algorithms or data structures
- **Architectural Diversity**: Varied system design approaches
- **Paradigm Diversity**: Different programming paradigms when applicable
- **Library/Framework Diversity**: Varied tooling or implementation platforms
- **Complexity Diversity**: Range from straightforward to sophisticated approaches

#### Solution Independence
- Begin each solution approach from first principles
- Avoid referencing or building upon other solutions
- Use different variable names and implementation patterns
- Apply distinct mental models to each approach
- Implement different optimizations and trade-offs

#### Solution Completeness
- Each solution must be independently viable and complete
- Include thorough error handling and edge case management
- Provide sufficient implementation detail for evaluation
- Document assumptions and limitations specific to each approach
- Estimate performance and resource characteristics

### Phase 3: Cross-Validation and Consensus Building

#### Consistency Analysis
- Compare solutions across multiple dimensions:
  - Functional correctness and output consistency
  - Algorithm complexity and performance characteristics
  - Handling of edge cases and error conditions
  - Security implications and vulnerabilities
  - Scalability and maintainability
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- Investigate discrepancies to determine their causes
- Assess confidence level in each solution component

#### Consensus Formation
- Identify core elements with strong agreement across solutions
- Evaluate conflicting approaches based on objective criteria
- Use weighted consensus for elements with partial agreement
- Document reasoning behind consensus decisions
- Highlight uncertainty where consensus cannot be reached

### Phase 4: Synthesized Solution Development

#### Principle-Guided Integration
- Build integrated solution using components with strongest consensus
- Incorporate best elements from multiple approaches
- Preserve architectural coherence in the synthesis
- Document integration decisions with clear rationale
- Maintain traceability to original solution paths

#### Enhanced Robustness
- Apply additional error handling for areas of uncertainty
- Implement validation checks for assumptions from consensus process
- Add defensive coding where solutions showed significant divergence
- Consider fallback mechanisms for contentious components
- Strengthen edge case handling identified through comparative analysis

#### Final Validation
- Verify synthesized solution against all identified requirements
- Test with edge cases discovered across all solution paths
- Confirm handling of error conditions from all approaches
- Assess overall solution quality relative to original paths
- Document remaining uncertainties or limitations

## Application Guidelines
- Scale the number of solution paths to problem complexity
- Increase path diversity for problems with high uncertainty

- Adjust level of detail to the specific technical domain
- Apply iterative refinement when consensus quality is insufficient

This framework systematically mitigates individual reasoning failures through solution diversity and structured consensus building, resulting in more reliable problem-solving outcomes.
