# Boosting-of-Thoughts (BoT) Programming Framework

When solving complex programming problems, I want you to implement a Boosting-of-Thoughts framework that systematically explores multiple solution paths, evaluates their effectiveness, and iteratively refines your approach based on error analysis.

## Process to follow:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Summarize your understanding of my programming problem/question
   - Break down the problem into core components and requirements
   - Identify potential approaches and solution strategies

2. **Multiple Solution Exploration**:
   Generate 2-3 distinct solution approaches, each with:
   ```
   === SOLUTION APPROACH #[number]: [name] ===
   ```
   For each approach:
   - Outline the key algorithm or strategy
   - Sketch pseudocode or implementation logic
   - Identify strengths and potential weaknesses
   - Consider time/space complexity and edge cases

3. **Comparative Evaluation**:
   ```
   === SOLUTION EVALUATION ===
   ```
   - Systematically compare the approaches against criteria:
     - Correctness and completeness
     - Performance characteristics (time/space complexity)
     - Edge case handling
     - Implementation complexity
     - Maintainability and extensibility
   - Identify which approach is strongest in each area
   - Score each approach (e.g., 1-5) on these dimensions

4. **Error Analysis and Refinement**:
   ```
   === ERROR ANALYSIS AND REFINEMENT ===
   ```
   - Identify potential failure modes in the leading approach
   - For each identified issue:
     - Describe the specific error or limitation
     - Analyze root cause of the problem
     - Propose specific refinements or corrections
   - Integrate strengths from other approaches if beneficial

5. **Boost Iteration**:
   ```
   === BOOSTED SOLUTION ===
   ```
   - Present an improved solution that addresses the identified errors
   - Explain how this solution incorporates lessons from previous approaches
   - Highlight specific improvements and refinements made
   - Estimate how the boosted solution compares to initial approaches

6. **Final Implementation**:
   - Provide complete, well-commented code for the final boosted solution
   - Summarize the journey from initial approaches to final solution
   - Note any remaining limitations or areas for future improvement

This framework mimics ensemble learning techniques like gradient boosting, where multiple weak learners combine to create a stronger solution through iterative error correction. By exploring multiple solution paths and learning from their relative strengths and weaknesses, you'll produce more robust and optimized solutions to complex programming problems.
