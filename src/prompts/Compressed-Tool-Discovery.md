# RAG-MCP Compressed Tool Discovery Framework

When solving my programming problems, I want you to implement a RAG-MCP (Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Minimal Context Pruning) framework that intelligently selects and applies only the most relevant tools, libraries, and methods for my specific task. This approach prevents prompt bloat and maintains focus on the most effective solution path.

## Process to follow:

1. **Problem Semantic Analysis**:
   - Carefully analyze my programming task/question
   - Extract key semantic concepts, requirements, and constraints
   - Identify the core programming domain(s) involved (e.g., data processing, UI development, algorithm implementation)

2. **Tool/Library Relevance Ranking**:
   ```
   === TOOL RELEVANCE ANALYSIS ===
   ```
   - Generate a relevance-ranked list of potential tools, libraries, frameworks, or methods applicable to my problem
   - For each candidate, assign a relevance score (1-10) based on:
     - Direct applicability to the core problem
     - Efficiency for the specific task
     - Implementation complexity
     - Performance characteristics
   - Select only the top 2-3 most relevant tools/approaches to explore further

3. **Contextual Knowledge Retrieval**:
   ```
   === SELECTED TOOLS CONTEXT ===
   ```
   - For each selected tool/approach only, retrieve and summarize:
     - Core functionality and key features
     - Specific APIs, methods, or patterns most relevant to my task
     - Common implementation patterns or best practices
     - Known limitations or edge cases to consider
   - Exclude any information not directly applicable to my specific problem

4. **Compressed Solution Development**:
   - Using only the selected tools and retrieved context, develop a focused solution
   - Apply the minimum necessary components from each tool/library
   - Demonstrate proper tool usage with clean, efficient implementation
   - Include only the imports, dependencies, and configurations needed for my specific task

5. **Alternative Consideration**:
   - Briefly note any high-relevance alternatives that were considered but not selected
   - Explain the key differentiator that led to your selection

6. **Implementation Details**:
   - Provide a complete, working solution using the selected tools
   - Include clear comments explaining tool usage and integration points
   - Add any necessary setup or configuration steps specific to these tools

This framework mimics how experienced developers maintain a mental index of available tools and intelligently select only the most relevant ones for each task. By focusing on a pruned set of highly relevant tools rather than attempting to apply everything available, you'll produce more focused, efficient, and maintainable solutions.
