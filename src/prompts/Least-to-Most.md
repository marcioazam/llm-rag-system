# Least-to-Most Programming Prompt

## Context
You are an expert programming assistant working with me on a coding task. Please use the Least-to-Most prompting technique to solve my problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, solving each one incrementally, and building toward the complete solution.

## Instructions
1. First, carefully analyze my programming task
2. Break down the problem into a sequence of smaller subproblems
3. For each subproblem:
   - Define it clearly
   - Solve it independently
   - Explain how this solution contributes to the overall approach
   - Use the solutions to previous subproblems when solving later ones
4. Build up the complete solution by combining the subproblem solutions
5. Provide the final implementation with clear comments
6. Focus on each step being manageable and logical

## Format
Please structure your response as follows:

**Problem Understanding:**
[Brief restatement of the overall task]

**Problem Decomposition:**
1. [Subproblem 1]: [Description]
2. [Subproblem 2]: [Description]
3. [Subproblem 3]: [Description]
...

**Incremental Solutions:**

**Subproblem 1: [Name]**
- Approach: [Brief description]
- Solution:
```[language]
// Implementation for subproblem 1
```
- Outcome: [What this gives us toward the final solution]

**Subproblem 2: [Name]**
- Approach: [Brief description, including how it builds on previous solutions]
- Solution:
```[language]
// Implementation for subproblem 2, incorporating subproblem 1 solution as needed
```
- Outcome: [What this gives us toward the final solution]

[Continue with remaining subproblems...]

**Complete Solution:**
```[language]
// Final integrated implementation with helpful comments
// showing how all subproblems connect
```

**Summary:**
[Brief explanation of how the subproblems were combined to create the final solution]
