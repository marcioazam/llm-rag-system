# Advanced Plan-Critique-Revise Framework

This structured framework enables methodical development of robust technical solutions through iterative planning, critical analysis, and systematic refinement. It's designed for maximum effectiveness across all programming languages, architectures, and problem domains.

## Methodology Overview

The framework consists of four sequential phases, each building upon the previous to progressively refine the solution:

1. **PLAN**: Comprehensive solution architecture and strategy
2. **CRITIQUE**: Multi-dimensional critical analysis
3. **REVISE**: Targeted refinement based on critique
4. **IMPLEMENT**: Final solution execution with quality safeguards

## Phase 1: PLAN - Strategic Solution Architecture

Begin with a comprehensive solution design incorporating:

### Problem Domain Analysis
- Deconstruct the problem into fundamental components and relationships
- Identify explicit and implicit requirements
- Map constraints, dependencies, and boundary conditions
- Establish success criteria and validation approaches
- Analyze potential security, performance, and scalability concerns

### Architectural Foundation
- Define core data structures, algorithms, and patterns
- Outline component interfaces and communication protocols
- Establish error handling and exception management strategies
- Determine state management and persistence approaches
- Consider deployment environment constraints and opportunities

### Implementation Strategy
- Break implementation into logical, manageable modules
- Prioritize components based on dependencies and complexity
- Define interfaces between components with precise contracts
- Establish naming conventions and code organization standards
- Plan integration points with external systems or libraries

### Execution Roadmap
- Create sequential development steps with clear milestones
- Anticipate potential roadblocks and alternative approaches
- Establish verification mechanisms for each development stage
- Define criteria for determining component completeness
- Consider incremental testing strategy throughout implementation

## Phase 2: CRITIQUE - Systematic Critical Analysis

Perform a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed plan using structured critique categories:

### Algorithmic Analysis
- Evaluate time and space complexity for critical operations
- Identify potential bottlenecks or performance concerns
- Assess algorithm selection against alternatives
- Verify correctness for edge cases and boundary conditions
- Consider optimization opportunities and their trade-offs

### Architectural Assessment
- Evaluate cohesion and coupling between components
- Assess modularity and extensibility of the design
- Analyze separation of concerns and responsibility allocation
- Review scalability under increased load or data volume
- Consider maintainability and future enhancement paths

### Implementation Practicality
- Identify potentially complex or error-prone implementation areas
- Assess technical feasibility within target environment
- Evaluate library and framework selection appropriateness
- Consider potential language-specific implementation challenges
- Review resource requirements and constraints

### Error Resilience
- Identify potential failure points and error conditions
- Assess error handling coverage and recovery mechanisms
- Review exception propagation and management
- Consider fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- Evaluate logging and debugging capabilities

### Security Evaluation
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the design
- Assess authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Review data validation and sanitization approaches
- Consider privacy implications and data protection
- Evaluate compliance with relevant security standards

### Requirement Verification
- Verify complete coverage of all stated requirements
- Identify potential misinterpretations or assumptions
- Assess alignment with implicit requirements and expectations
- Review edge case and exception handling
- Evaluate user experience and interface considerations

## Phase 3: REVISE - Strategic Refinement

Based on critique findings, systematically refine the solution:

### Prioritized Improvements
- Categorize critique findings by severity and impact
- Prioritize addressing critical issues first
- Develop specific solutions for each identified concern
- Balance short-term fixes with long-term architectural improvements
- Maintain consistency across all solution components

### Architectural Enhancements
- Refine component boundaries and interfaces based on critique
- Strengthen modularity and reduce unnecessary coupling
- Improve separation of concerns where needed
- Enhance scalability and performance characteristics
- Reinforce error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Algorithmic Optimization
- Replace inefficient algorithms with optimal alternatives
- Apply specific optimization techniques to critical paths
- Improve memory utilization and resource management
- Enhance handling of edge cases and special conditions
- Balance readability with performance requirements

### Security Reinforcement
- Implement additional security controls where needed
- Strengthen input validation and output encoding
- Enhance authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Apply principle of least privilege throughout the design
- Incorporate secure coding practices appropriate to language/platform

### Documentation Upgrades
- Clarify complex logic and architectural decisions
- Document security considerations and mitigations
- Explain performance optimizations and their rationale
- Note known limitations and future enhancement opportunities
- Provide clear usage examples and API documentation

## Phase 4: IMPLEMENT - Disciplined Execution

Execute the revised plan with disciplined implementation:

### Quality-Focused Coding
- Implement solution following language-specific best practices
- Apply consistent coding standards and patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Add appropriate comments explaining complex logic
- Follow security best practices for the specific technology

### Continuous Validation
- Implement unit tests for critical components
- Verify behavior against edge cases identified in critique
- Confirm expected performance characteristics
- Validate security controls and error handling
- Ensure compliance with all requirements

### Progressive Refinement
- Implement core functionality first, then enhance
- Refactor as needed to maintain code quality
- Apply optimizations identified in the revision phase
- Ensure consistent error handling throughout
- Maintain alignment with architectural vision

## Implementation Guidelines

When applying this framework:

1. **Clarity**: Explicitly label each phase (PLAN, CRITIQUE, REVISE, IMPLEMENT)
2. **Depth**: Adjust the detail level based on problem complexity
3. **Methodology**: Maintain disciplined separation between phases
4. **Transparency**: Document rationale for key decisions in each phase
5. **Adaptation**: Tailor emphasis to address domain-specific concerns
6. **Iteration**: When necessary, cycle through multiple critique-revise loops

This multi-phase approach produces solutions that are not only technically sound but also resilient, maintainable, and aligned with best practices for the specific technical domain.
