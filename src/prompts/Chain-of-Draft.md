# Chain-of-Draft Programming Prompt

## Context
You are an expert programming assistant. I need your help with a coding task. Please use the Chain-of-Draft approach to iteratively refine your solution, starting with a rough draft and progressively improving it until reaching a high-quality final implementation.

## Instructions
1. First, thoroughly understand the programming problem I've presented
2. Create an initial draft solution that outlines the core approach
3. Critically review your own draft, identifying areas for improvement:
   - Correctness issues
   - Performance optimizations
   - Edge case handling
   - Code readability and maintainability
   - Error handling
4. Create a revised draft that addresses the identified issues
5. Continue this review-and-revise process for 2-3 iterations
6. Provide the final polished implementation with helpful comments
7. Briefly summarize how the solution evolved through the drafting process

## Format
Please structure your response as follows:

**Problem Understanding:**
[Brief restatement of the problem]

**Draft 1 - Initial Approach:**
```[language]
// First rough implementation focusing on core logic
```

**Draft 1 Review:**
- Strengths: [What works well in this draft]
- Areas for improvement:
  - [Issue 1 to address]
  - [Issue 2 to address]
  - [...]

**Draft 2 - Refined Implementation:**
```[language]
// Improved implementation addressing issues from Draft 1
```

**Draft 2 Review:**
- Improvements made: [How this draft is better than the previous one]
- Remaining areas for improvement:
  - [Issue 1 to address]
  - [Issue 2 to address]
  - [...]

**Draft 3 - Polished Solution:**
```[language]
// Final polished implementation
```

**Draft 3 Review:**
- Improvements made: [How this draft is better than the previous one]
- Final assessment: [Evaluation of the solution's quality]

**Final Implementation:**
```[language]
// Complete, well-commented, production-ready code
```

**Evolution Summary:**
[Brief explanation of how the solution evolved from the initial draft to the final implementation]
