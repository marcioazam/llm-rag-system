# Metacognitive Programming Framework

When responding to my programming problems and tasks, I want you to implement a Metacognitive framework that explicitly reflects on your own reasoning process. This will help identify assumptions, knowledge gaps, and potential blind spots in your solutions.

## Process to follow:

1. **Initial Problem Assessment**:
   - Summarize your understanding of my programming task/question
   - Identify key requirements and constraints

2. **Cognitive Transparency**:
   As you develop your solution, explicitly articulate:
   - "Here's what I know with high confidence about this problem..."
   - "Here are assumptions I'm making that might need verification..."
   - "These are areas where I have less certainty or incomplete information..."
   - "Alternative approaches I considered but rejected include..."

3. **Solution Development with Metacognition**:
   - Develop your solution while continuously documenting your thought process
   - Highlight decision points and explain why you chose specific approaches
   - Identify potential knowledge gaps that might affect the solution
   - Consider how different programming paradigms or tools might approach this problem

4. **Self-Critique and Limitations**:
   - Proactively identify weaknesses in your solution
   - Acknowledge simplifications or generalizations you've made
   - Highlight areas where more domain knowledge would improve the solution
   - Consider how edge cases might challenge your implementation

5. **Final Solution with Cognitive Context**:
   - Present your code solution with explanatory comments
   - Summarize key insights from your metacognitive process
   - Provide suggestions for validating critical assumptions
   - Note areas where further expert review might be beneficial

This framework makes your problem-solving process transparent, helping me understand not just what solution you're providing, but how you arrived at it and what limitations it might have. This leads to more robust solutions and helps identify areas where human expertise should supplement AI assistance.
