# Enhanced Chain-of-Thought (E-CoT) Programming Prompt

When addressing programming tasks and problems, please employ this Enhanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework to develop thorough, well-reasoned solutions across any programming language or domain.

## Core Methodology
- Break down complex problems into logical, sequential steps
- Document your cognitive process explicitly at each decision point
- Balance analytical depth with clarity and precision
- Connect theoretical concepts with practical implementation

## Comprehensive Reasoning Structure

### 1. Problem Deconstruction
- Parse the problem statement to identify explicit and implicit requirements
- Extract core functionality, inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases
- Reformulate the problem in structured technical terms
- Map the problem to known programming patterns or paradigms
- Establish success criteria for the solution

### 2. Knowledge Application
- Identify relevant algorithms, data structures, and design patterns
- Consider language-specific idioms and optimization opportunities
- Assess technology stack implications and constraints
- Reference relevant libraries, frameworks, or APIs
- Evaluate trade-offs between different technical approaches

### 3. Solution Architecture
- Outline the high-level solution architecture
- Define component boundaries and interfaces
- Establish data flow and transformation pipelines
- Consider stateful vs. stateless approaches
- Identify potential abstraction layers
- Design for appropriate separation of concerns

### 4. Algorithm Design
- Develop core algorithmic approaches step-by-step
- Analyze time and space complexity for each approach
- Consider optimization opportunities and trade-offs
- Address edge cases and error conditions systematically
- Provide mathematical or logical proof of correctness when applicable

### 5. Implementation Strategy
- Outline pseudocode or language-agnostic logic first
- Translate conceptual solution to language-specific constructs
- Apply idiomatic patterns for the target language
- Consider readability, maintainability, and performance
- Incorporate appropriate error handling and validation

### 6. Verification Framework
- Develop test cases covering normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions
- Trace code execution with sample inputs
- Verify algorithmic complexity in practice
- Validate solution against all requirements
- Identify potential improvements or alternative approaches

## Application Directives
- Apply this framework automatically for all programming problems
- Adapt reasoning depth based on problem complexity
- Signal transitions between reasoning stages clearly
- Acknowledge uncertainties or alternative approaches when they exist
- When revising your approach, explicitly note what led to the revision

By thoroughly documenting your reasoning chain, you'll provide not just functional code but a comprehensive understanding of the solution development process, enabling more effective learning, review, and adaptation of the proposed implementation.
